### How to compile
Open the project with your IDE and execute gradle build. Finally you will get the jar at /project/build/libs/CustomNameplates-xxx-all.jar. 

### I don't know how to build with IDE
Install JDK 17 and set the JDK installation path to JAVA_HOME as an environment variable.\
Start powershell and change directory to the project folder.\
Execute ".\gradlew build" and get the jar at /project/build/libs/CustomNameplates-xxx-all.jar. 

### API
Plugin is scheduled to be recoded on December. At that time API would be available. For the moment you can use the jar as local library.
