  #            May exist conflict with other plugins that use team
  #
  # ================ Entity ================
  #  Plugin would summon fake armorstands packets riding the player
  #  Advantage:
  #            No lag (The principle is different from TAB)
  #            Support multiple lines (based on resource pack side tech)
  #

  team:
    # Team mode only supports one line, so it is using a prefix/suffix system to extend the player name info

    # to use PlaceholderAPI to be able to use this feature to the fullest extent.
    # keep it empty if you don't want to enable this feature.
    # You should make sure the papi doesn't contain "&" (legacy color code)
    # Nameplates work on the custom font system where legacy color code is not supported!
    # Please use minimessage format: https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html
